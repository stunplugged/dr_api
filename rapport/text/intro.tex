This mini-project is about creating various backend functions for a video application. These backend functions shall make it possible for the user to navigate and search for specific videos in a large video directory using the BaseX XML database.

The XML documents describing all the videos in this video directory is delivered by the Danish national broadcaster Danmarks Radio, who have made their videos available through an open API using XML.

All XML documents used in this project is downloaded from this site: www.dr.dk/nu/api via a standard webbrowser and afterwards loaded into the BaseX XML database for further processing.

There is no description available for this open API, there for the first task in this project is to study and describe the content and structure of the available XML documents.
